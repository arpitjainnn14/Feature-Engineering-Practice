This repository documents my Feature Engineering learning journey, where I explore techniques, best practices, and real-world applications that strengthen my data preprocessing and model-building foundation.

It serves as a personal knowledge base showcasing hands-on experiments, practical examples, and insights that helped me develop a strong understanding of how to transform raw data into meaningful features for better machine learning performance.
